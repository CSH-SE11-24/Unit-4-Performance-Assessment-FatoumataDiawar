1. Descriptions of each page

 My home page is the page which introduces user to the website. It shortly gives a breif summary, and encourages users to learn more about the buisness, by clicking the links at the bottom or using the navigation bar to get to our about me page.

 My About me page gives the user more insight to the buisness, and the story of the founder. It also tells user our buisness location and hours.

 My book with us page shows the varous amounts of hairstyles that the buisness provides. However, there are so many different unique hairstyles that can't just be put into a category, so I included a place where clients can choose to talk to the buisness workers so that they can show them a reference photo of the style they wanted.




2. How did using Bootstrap change your programming experience?
   
It made it hard and easy at the same time. Bootstrap provided me with the building blocks to create my whole website, however when it came to styling and making the website look the way I wanted it to, it way way harder. I had to constantly override bootstraps CSS to do simple styling in CSS, which was a little frusturating.

3. How closely were you able to follow your MVP plan? Why or why not?
Not close at all. I ran into a lot of issues when it came to styling or modifying components so that's what probably prevented me from following the MVP plan. But I didn't like the plan anyway, I think it added on another layer of stress.

4. What features are you the most proud of?
I am proud of my autoplaying carousel! and the aesthetics of the about us page


6. What would you add if you had more time?
I would add another external file for each hairstyle where the user can enter the length, size, and color of the hair style and get like an external confirmation page when they click the 'Book now!' button.
